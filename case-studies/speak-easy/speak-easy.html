          The Speak Easy App is a Mobile Application built with React-Native.
          It makes use of firestore for data storage 
          The user can sign in to the message board and join the conversation with text messages,
          images from thier device storage, images taken from their device camera. They can also
          share their location using the GPS system in their device.

        <p class="subheading-description">
          Speak Easy was a part of the Career Foundry Web Development Course. 
          React-Native is an incredibly powerful library for building mobile apps 
          and my time with it so far has been very exciting. I feel like I have just 
          scratched the surface of the framework and I look forward to using it more in
          the future.

        <p class="subheading-description">
          The main objective with this project was to take a design and develop it using the React-Native 
          framework. There is always a learning curve with a new technology, language, or framework. 
          My main goal was to find mulitiple ways to get to the same layout and to fully develop an understanding
          of the framework.

          The process for this project was similar to others by way of establishing a working skeleton,
          then adding features one at a time to ensure full functionality before moving on the the next.
          What made this process different was that the React-Native framework cut out so much of the 
          structural development. This project went incredibly fast and I intend to return to it in 
          order to add some more functionality.  I look forward to seeing what other features are built in
          to the framework.

            As I mentioned, this project went incredibly fast. There were few challenges along the way but a couple 
            things do stand out.
            <br> The first is the predesigned features inside the framework. Buttons, for example, are difficult to 
            style as they have a predefined style already set. This predefined style is also device specific so
            extra care must be taken in designing to ensure a consistent look across all devices. I made use of some
            touchability features in order to style my own buttons rather than using the fallback of the default
            button style. 
            <br> The second difficulty was minor but it was in getting the layout of the display to fit the 
            provided design. This wasn't a difficulty until the keyboard popped on screen and pushed pieces of the 
            design out of view. A fix was provided to ensure the input bar was not hidden by the keyboard, but then 
            the keyboard moved other features out of view. I was able to use a container to keep all of the input 
            fields together so they would move as one when the keyboard popped up.
