        <p class="subheading-description">
          The myFlix Web Application consists of a backend database built with MongoDB, 
          it was Tested with Postman, and deployed to Heroku. This custombuilt API 
          uses Node.js and REST architecture. 
          <br>  The front end of the application makes use of React to display the information
          fetched from the database in a single page application. The main view displays 
          a list of movies which the user can select various links to display additional 
          information about the movie itself, the diretor, or the genre. 
          <br> The user can also make their own login and store their favorites from the list of
          movies in their own profile database.

        <p class="subheading-description">
          myFlix was a part of the Career Foundry Web Development Course. 
          Making use of the MERN tech stack (MongoDB, Express JS, React JS/Redux, and NodeJS)
          I learned how to build a custom API and database with a list of movies I selected. 
          I then learned how to access the database and display the information in an attractive 
          single page application.

        <p class="subheading-description">
          The main objective with this project was to build and access a database with 
          the Mern Tech stack and to learn as much as possible along the way. I found 
          that each component of the MERN stack could be a career in itself. I spent my 
          time in this exercise analyzing each component and step to determine if it was
          one that I could spend my career in. I used this porject as a testing ground 
          for where I would like to spend my developer energy.

        <p>
          The approach to this project was to take the time necessary to build each component
          methodically and to ensure that each was working correctly before moving on to the next.
          After all, what good is a front end to access a database if the API doesn't access the 
          database correctly? While in this approach I was able to go through each stages nuances
          and really assess what parts brought me the greatest sense of satisfaction.

        <div class="challenges-content">
          <p class="challenges-description">
            The challenges to this project were fairly routine I should think. Code not working
            then finding I had misused or referenced a node incorrectly. Simply fixes that come 
            with development. I found the database side to be incredibly exciting. When it worked
            it just worked. Which is fantastic. 
            <br> So perhaps the biggest challenge through this project was the styling component. 
            Styling is what I enjoy themost about any project. Taking a solution and making it as 
            visually appealing as possible is where I have found I like to live. 
            <br> Where the challenge comes in is there is a side of my brain that really enjoys 
            when something just functions, pure and simple - black and white. I find teh simple 
            functionality to be a gratifying end to my work. The other side of my brain, however; 
            screams to design and tweak something just a bit more to make it look really good. 
            In my case I sometimes find that I either rush a bit of functional code in order to 
            get to the styling, or I spend more time on the function of the code that by the time
            I get to the styling I just want to be finished. 
            <br> The end of this train of thought is that I either need to focus my attention in 
            the area I get the most fulfillment out of. Or I need to split into two different people.
