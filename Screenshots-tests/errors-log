HTML Errors:
 I had two errors here.
 They were both related to the name of the files About McCotter.html and Contact McCotter.html.
 Spaces were not allowed so I changed them back to about.html and contact.html.

CSS Errors
 Wow, a lot of spacing issues...
  expected white space : added white space
  expected indent of two spaces : went through all code and adjusted accordingly
  expected #594F4F to be #594f4f and other color syntax issues : changed case of letters
  Unexpected unit length-zero-no-unit : took out the value
  expected PX to be px : changed it
  expected leading zero : added one
  expected shorthand properties : ignored this for now as I know both ways work
  Property "fill" doesn't exist : um... it does though. Yep the sun changes color. Weird. 
  Unexpected length zero unit for transform : ignore as this is the beginning point for the animation

  I began to ignore indentation errors as they are legion and do not like the autospacing sublime text had built in to the file. I tried to turn them off but couldn't make it work.

  The only errors remaining when I finished were indentation errors. A shorthand error on the grid of the about page, and property "fill" doesn't exist. But it does and the animation works as expected in all the browsers. Not sure why that's throwing an error.
